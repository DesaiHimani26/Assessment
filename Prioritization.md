## Criteria for Prioritizing Test Cases
1. Criticality to Business Operations:
- High-priority tests should cover functionalities that directly impact the business, such as the ability for customers to complete payments successfully. 
- Lower-priority tests would cover features like displaying payment history, which is important but less critical compared to completing the actual transaction.

2. Frequency of Use:
- Test cases related to frequently used functionalities, such as adding items to the cart, initiating checkout, and processing payments, should be tested early to ensure they are functional and stable.

3. User Impact:
 - Test cases that affect the end-user experience, such as a successful checkout process or error messages when a payment fails, are prioritized. Failures in these areas would lead to a poor user experience and abandoned transactions.

4. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements:
- Compliance-related test cases (e.g., PCI-DSS standards for secure payment processing) should be prioritized since any failure in this area could have legal or financial implications.
   
5. Risk and Complexity:
 - Features that pose a higher risk to the system, such as interactions with the third-party payment gateway or sensitive data handling (security and encryption), should be tested first.


## Steps for Prioritizing Test Cases
1. Create a requirements traceability matrix (RTM)
2. Involve Product managers, developers and QA 
3. Conduct a risk assessment to evaluate which features and test cases carry the most risk
   

## Adjusting Prioritization Strategy for Requirement Changes
During the testing phase, requirements often change due to business needs, updated functionality, or feedback from testing. Here's how to adjust prioritization:

1. Evaluate Impact of Change:
- Perform impact analysis on the newly introduced changes to assess which areas of the system are affected. This helps identify whether any previously low-priority test cases have now become high-priority due to the change.

2. Reprioritize Test Cases:
- Update the test case prioritization based on the changes.

3.  Risk Assessment:
- Review the risk profile of the new or modified features. For example, new functionality in the payment gateway may introduce new risks that need to be addressed before release.
Adjust the prioritization of test cases based on the revised risk assessment. New high-risk features should be tested first, even if they were not part of the initial test plan.


## Communicating Changes to Project Stakeholders
To ensure transparency and alignment, itâ€™s essential to communicate changes in the test plan and prioritization clearly with stakeholders:

1. Regular Status Updates:
Conduct daily or weekly stand-ups to update stakeholders (project managers, developers, business analysts) on testing progress, changes in priorities, and any challenges faced.
Share updated risk assessments and test case priorities with stakeholders, explaining how the changes align with overall project objectives.

2. Create a Dashboard :
   Create a Dashboard to track Progress of the Testing which gives clear picture of timeline and open Issues with their severity and priority

3. Document update:
Update the test plan and traceability matrix to reflect the new priorities and ensure that stakeholders have access to the most up-to-date documentation.
Use collaborative tools like Jira or Confluence to track changes in requirements and associated test case updates.

4. Risk Highlight:
Communicate any changes in risk due to the reprioritization. For example, if newly added test cases introduce additional risk, explain the potential consequences and the mitigation steps being taken.
Highlight the impact on timelines and resource allocation, especially if the introduction of new requirements increases the testing workload.

5. Adjust Timeline:
If the introduction of new requirements or reprioritization affects the testing schedule, inform stakeholders about the adjusted timelines and any potential delays.
Provide alternatives, such as reducing scope or conducting parallel testing efforts, if project timelines are tight.
